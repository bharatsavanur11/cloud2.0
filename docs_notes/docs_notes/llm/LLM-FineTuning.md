Parameter efficient fine tuning:

How to find out which parameters in model are trainable?


PEFT/LORA  - get_peft_model - how to get that data?

First one: Full fine tuning with instruction prompts.
Understand Rouge score/metrics

Open FLANT5 model and fine tune it.



in LORA-  what is rank? Understand how it works and how we can fine tune it on a single GPU.

what are differnent PEFT models?
What is epochs?

f' strings are formatted strings.

Inference from the data?

do the changes related to Redis RAG data? Can we have 
our  own clusters.


What does required gradient means?

Why 3 double inverted commas for f-print in python? - they are called as triple quoted string
and are used to do multi line comments.

Work on creating and downloading ur own model and then finetuning it. -  pending tasks.

Understand Rouge evaluation metrics. - How can we do this in real world? Do we need people who will actually 
summarize the text?

How to use JSON Data to finet tune the model?


Infrastructure layer -  pay as u go 
LLM Model -  Foundational plus fine tuned
